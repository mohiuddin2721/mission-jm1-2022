            <p>Hello! My name is KM Mohiuddin Patwary and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2021 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!</p>

            <p>While learning the foundational skills to become a Web Developer is relatively straightforward, becoming a good Web Developer can be more challenging, requiring ongoing learning and effort over years. though, it’s well worth the effort – web development can be an extremely fulfilling (and well-paying) career and nothing worth having comes easy.</p>

            <h1>Global Community</h1>
            <p>Communities are usually built on shared struggles of individuals learning in a particular region, and the goals of each community differ per the individual's collective needs. Over the years, these developer communities have grown across the world with different goals and missions but still with the general aim of providing a platform for developers to learn, interact, share ideas, support each other and grow.</p>
